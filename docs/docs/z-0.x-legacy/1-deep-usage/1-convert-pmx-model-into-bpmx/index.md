# Convert PMX model into BPMX

Babylon PMX(BPMX) is the optimized PMX format for babylon-mmd.

It reduces model load time By merge all dependencies(texture) into a single file.

## Download MMD Model: "YYB Piano dress Miku"

If you have a pmx model you want, you can use it.

In this tutorial, we will use the "YYB Piano dress Miku" model.

You can download it from **[here](https://www.deviantart.com/mamiya-mmd/art/YYB-Piano-dress-Miku-and-Rin-Models-Download-831030256)**.

## Convert PMX model into BPMX

You can use [PMX to BPMX Converter](https://noname0310.github.io/babylon-mmd/pmx_converter/) to convert PMX model into BPMX.

The pmx model typically places the texture asset as a child in the root directory.

Therefore, you need to put the root directory of pmx in the converter.

Then select pmx from the loaded file list and load it.
