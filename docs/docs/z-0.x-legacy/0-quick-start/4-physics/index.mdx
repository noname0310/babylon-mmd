# Use Physics Engine

Use physics v2 to perform physics simulation.

## Emable Physics

Enable the physics using havok physics engine.

```typescript title="src/sceneBuilder.ts"
import HavokPhysics from "@babylonjs/havok";
// ...
scene.enablePhysics(new Vector3(0, -9.8 * 10, 0), new HavokPlugin(true, await HavokPhysics()));
```

## Use MMD Physics

Create new `MmdPhysics` and pass it to `MmdRuntime`.

```typescript title="src/sceneBuilder.ts"
const mmdRuntime = new MmdRuntime(scene, new MmdPhysics(scene));
```

:::info
`MmdPhysics` is powered by havok physics, which can lead to much different results than MMD.

For heavier, but more MMD-like results, you can use `MmdAmmoPhysics`, which is powered by ammo.js
