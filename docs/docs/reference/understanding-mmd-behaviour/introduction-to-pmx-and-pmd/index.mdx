# Introduction to PMX and PMD

This section explains what information PMX and PMD files consist of, how MMD interprets that information,
and how babylon-mmd implements MMD's behavior.

## PMX/PMD File Overview

PMX and PMD files are 3D model file formats used in Miku Miku Dance (MMD).

Basically, PMX/PMD files are single binary files that contain all data except texture files.

Since these file formats have no documented specifications, only information known through reverse engineering analysis exists, so there may be minor errors.

Also, since there are no official names for each piece of information,
this document arbitrarily assigns common names to each piece of information for explanation.

### Differences from Modern 3D Asset Formats

Modern widely-used 3D asset formats (e.g. glTF, FBX, etc.) have structures designed to represent
Scene Graphs that include 3D models.
In contrast, PMX and PMD files basically contain only information for representing a single geometry-based 3D model,
and do not include information for representing elements other than 3D models such as cameras, lighting, animations, and Scene Graphs.

### PMX Files

PMX is an improved version of PMD that provides better structure and more features than PMD.

Currently known PMX file versions are 2.0 and 2.1.

PMX 2.1 supports various features such as Soft Body Physics, Vertex Color, PhysicsMorph, etc.,
but only PMX Editor supports this specification, and since MMD also does not support version 2.1,
version 2.1 is not practically used.

:::note
babylon-mmd's `PmxParser` supports parsing PMX 2.1 files, but `PmxLoader` does not load them.
babylon-mmd supports most of the PMX 2.0 specification, and unprocessed data is preserved during the model loading process.

### PMD Files

PMD is the previous version of PMX, with simpler structure and limited features compared to PMX.

PMX files are not backward compatible with PMD files, and it is presumed that in MMD, models loaded as PMD files are processed with separate logic from PMX files.

:::note
babylon-mmd performs the task of converting PMD files to PMX format simultaneously while `PmdParser` parses PMD files.
Therefore, there is no separate logic for processing PMD models, and all MMD models are processed with common logic.

## PMX/PMD File Structure and Parsing Method

PMX/PMD files are Little Endian binary files containing various data types.

These files are structured in a typical Length-Prefixed format. For example, when representing Skeleton data,
the number of Bones is indicated first, followed by sequential listing of each Bone's information.
The size of each data can be fixed or variable length, and the order of data is always the same.

Data alignment is not enforced, and each field is stored consecutively in the binary file.

## PMX/PMD File Components

PMX/PMD files consist of the following main components:

### Header

The header of PMX/PMD files includes the file version, model name, comments, etc.
This information serves as file metadata, used for identifying and managing models.

In the case of PMX files, English fields such as english model name and english comment exist, but are generally not well utilized.

### Geometry
### Texture
### Material
### Skeleton
### Morph
### DisplayFrame
### Physics
