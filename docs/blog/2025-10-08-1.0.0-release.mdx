*This MMD render was created using babylon-mmd.*

I am pleased to announce the release of babylon-mmd version 1.0.0!

## Refining the API

This release does not ship headline features, but it completes the last major breaking changes needed to tidy up the API. The goal is to give developers a stable surface they can rely on as the project moves forward.

## Commitment to Maintenance

babylon-mmd will continue to be actively maintained. Expect ongoing care, issue triage, and incremental improvements that keep the library healthy for production use.

## Documentation Ready for You

The documentation overhaul is finished. Nearly everything you need to start using the library now lives in the docs site, from setup guides to deep dives into runtime behavior.

## Areas We Still Want to Improve

Even with the 1.0 milestone, there is more we want to tackle to bring the MMD experience even closer to parity:

- **Shading:** Support for ground-projected shadows, material flags, and related shading features is still on the roadmap.
- **Debugging Tools:** Bone rendering for debugging and embedding in end-user applications remains to be built.
- **External Parents:** We do not yet support external parent relationships.

After three years of focused research on this space, I am proud of how accurately babylon-mmd reproduces MMD at runtime. There is still room to grow, but the current fidelity is something I stand behind.

## Looking Ahead

I hope babylon-mmd becomes a launchpad for web-based MMD experiences and inspires open-source implementations and experiments across the community. Ultimately, I want to see the MMD ecosystem flourish, and I am deeply grateful to the Babylon.js community for providing the foundation that makes all of this possible.
